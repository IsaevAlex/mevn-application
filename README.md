# Build full stack web apps with MEVN Stack

The acronym “MEVN” stands for “MongoDB Express.js VueJS Node.js”. 
In this app, I am going to show how to create a basic MEVN (MongoDB/Express/VueJS/Node.js) 
Stack application.

### What to expect from this app:

- Full stack application with MEVN architecture
- CRUD operations via Express.js
- Connect APIs with MongoDB(we will be using mongoose)


## Usage

#### Run client
```
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Run server
```
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
